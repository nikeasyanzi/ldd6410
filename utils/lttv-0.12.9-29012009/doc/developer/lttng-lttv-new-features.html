<br>
<br>
<P>
One might ask what are the new features present in LTTng and LTTV that are not
in the LTT toolkit. Here are the major enhancements.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of the new features in LTTV :<br>
Modular architecture based on plugins.<br>
Reads from several traces. It supports SMP machines.<br>
Synchronized graphical views. Plugins can cooperate to show the trace
together.<br>
Supports event types with metainformation.<br>
Supports huge traces : 10-15 GB.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are the new features in LTTng :<br>
Real ~100ns time accuracy, with monotonic increment.<br>
Exports trace metainformation within the trace stream.<br>
Supports arbitrary architecture type size or endianness.<br>
Supports variable size event records.<br>
Supports compiler and architecture independant elementary types.<br>
Supports ISO C compatible dynamic alignment of data.<br>
Solid atomic (lockless) logging (NMI, traps, faults handler safe).<br>
Supports writing to multiple traces at once (eventually with different
filters).<br>
Uses separate information channels for each information provider and for
metadata events.<br>
