Seeing that a very precise hook call ordering is needed when processing events
(especially the order for calling state update hooks and event delivery hooks),
this document defines a new type and interface that permits to merge all kind of
hooks, eventually sorted by the priority associated to them.

- Type LttvHooks with priorities

This is a modification to the actual LttvHooks that associates a priority with
each hook. The container for this type would be a garray, just like hook.c, but
hooks would be added at the right position in the list, by priority. Hooks in a
hook list are ordered by priority : from highest priority (0) to
lowest (99). The default priority is 50 (defined as LTTV_PRIO_DEFAULT).

A new lttv_hooks_call_merge that will get the hooks from two hook lists in the
right order will deal with the multiple lists priority problem.
