<br>
Here are the roadmaps for the LTTV and LTTng development. I use a priority indice
for the TODO items :<br>
(1) : very high priority<br>
(10): lowest priority<br>
<br>
<br>
Dependencies are written between brackets [ ].<br>
The # symbol marks who is currently working on the item.<br>
The % symbol marks who is interested in the realisation of the item.<br>

<big>LTT Next Generation Roadmap<small><br>
<br>
* TODO<br>
(1) Get lttng ascii dump to work.<br>
	# <A HREF="mailto:Lai Jiangshan <laijs@cn.fujitsu.com>">Lai Jiangshan</A><br>
- Create periodical buffer flush per-cpu timer for data streaming.<br>
	# <A HREF="mailto:Mathieu Desnoyers <compudj@krystal.dyndns.org>">Mathieu Desnoyers</A><br>
- Modify LTTng/lttd/lttv to support variable-sized buffers.<br>
	# <A HREF="mailto:Mathieu Desnoyers <compudj@krystal.dyndns.org>">Mathieu Desnoyers</A><br>
(1) Support CPUs with scalable frequency.<br>
(1) Post core set of patches to LKML for mainlining.<br>
(2) Create 3rd generation of userspace tracing.<br>
(3) Bring stack dump in sync with new lttng.<br>
(4) Dump mounts. (to fix)<br>
(4) Add Xen support. (Trace buffer desallocation needs to be fixed)<br>
(4) integrate NPTL instrumentation (see
<A HREF="http://nptltracetool.sourceforge.net/">PTT</A>).<br>
(4) Probe calibration kernel module.<br>
(4) Make page faults detect nested fault without nesting 4 times in the page
fault handler. (or use vmalloc_sync_all at each tracing module load)<br>
(5) Add boot time tracing support.<br>
(5) Integrate LTTng and lttd with LKCD.<br>
	# <A HREF="mailto:Lai Jiangshan <laijs@cn.fujitsu.com>>">Lai Jiangshan</A><br>
(7) Integrate periodical dump of perfctr hardware counters.<br>
(8) Integrate SystemTAP logging with LTTng.<br>
(8) Integrate periodical dump of SystemTAP computed information.<br>
(9) Add support for setjmp/longjmp and jump tables instrumentation to
ltt-instrument-functions.<br>
(3) port LTTng to :<br>
ARM OMAP3<BR>
% Nokia<BR>
<br>
<br>
<big>LTTV Roadmap<small><br>
<br>
* TODO<br>
(3) Add cluster support.<br>
(4) Statistics per time window.<br>
(4) Add Xen per physical CPU view.<br>
(4) Add Xen per vcpu view.<br>
(4) Disable plugins when threshold reached (i.e. too much process in control
flow view). Draw, and, when the threshold is reached, stop drawing. The global
statistics view can inhibit showing the per process stats.<br>
(4) Add a visual artifact : PID 0 could be named swapper instead of UNNAMED for
cpus > 0.<br>
(4) Add event specific fields support to filter.<br>
(4) Add a periodic event interval view. (useful to verify event periodicity)<br>
(4) create a graphical per cpu activity view.<br>
(4) Filter by target process.<br>
(4) Compensate for time spent in probes in LTTV analysis.<br>
(4) Add CPU, network, disk, memory usage histogram. [Per interval statistics]<br>
(4) Add sort by process priority in the control flow view (must also instrument
priority information of the processes).<br>
% Airbus<br>
(5) Add Python scripting hooks.<br>
(5) Add GUI interface to take an hybrid trace.<br>
(5) Automatically detect traces with too much processes and disable faulty operations.<br>
(5) Event sequence detector (inspired from regular expressions).<br>
(7) Create a hardware counter viewer (low cost rate counters : L1 cache miss,
page faults, interrupts...). This will be a generalisation of the event rate
view into a view of the evolution of a user definable event field.<br>
<br>
* TO FIX<br>
(10) Add cancel button to LTTV filter GUI window.<br>
(10) Sometimes, in the control flow view, a process with 0 creation time is
created in addition to the real process itself. Seems to be caused by end of
process life.<br>
(10) Statistics do not take in account the time spent in the mode present at
the beginning of the trace. Example : real time spent in system call on behalf
of process 0.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
* TODO (low priority)<br>
enhance RPM packages for lttng kernel<br>
Export buffers with time constraint for "live" visualisation. Use
ltt_force_switch periodically from a timer to insure slow channels do not
interfere with viewing.<br>
Have an optional round-robin mode to write information into multiple channels
from the same source.<br>
<br>
* Need to be discussed<br>
Drop ltt-module-register and ltt-module-unregister, use exported variables.<br>
drop ltt_filter_control, use functions pointers instead.<br>
Remove ltt-base.c.<br>
