This package contains the trace reading library and trace viewing tools for
the new Linux Trace Toolkit trace format.

* Compiling

gcc 3.2 or better
gtk 2.4 or better development libraries
  (Debian : libgtk2.0, libgtk2.0-dev)
  (Fedora : gtk2, gtk2-devel)
  note : For Fedora users : this might require at least core 3 from Fedora,
  or you might have to compile your own GTK2 library.
glib 2.4 or better development libraries
  (Debian : libglib2.0-0, libglib2.0-dev)
  (Fedora : glib2, glib2-devel)
libpopt development libraries
  (Debian : libpopt0, libpopt-dev)
  (Fedora : popt)
libpango development libraries
  (Debian : libpango1.0, libpango1.0-dev)
  (Fedora : pango, pango-devel)
libc6 development librairies 
  (Debian : libc6, libc6-dev)
  (Fedora : glibc, glibc)


To compile the source tree from a tarball, simply follow these steps :

- ./configure
- make
- make install

After running ./configure, you can also go in specific subdirectories and
use make, make install.


* Quick Start

See QUICKSTART.


* Source Tree Structure

Here is the tree structure of the Linux Trace Toolkit Viewer package.

ltt/		New trace format reading library.
README		This file.
debian/		Debian config files (currently empty).
doc/		Documentation.
doc/user/	User related documentation.
doc/developer/	Developer related documentation.
lttv/		Linux Trace Toolkit trace analysis tool and viewer.
lttv/modules/	Linux Trace Toolkit analysis tool and viewer plugin modules.
specs/		RPM config files (currently empty).


* For Developers

This source tree is based on the autotools suite from GNU to simplify
portability. Here are some things you should have on your system in order to
compile the subversion repository tree :


- GNU autotools (automake >=1.7, autoconf >=2.50, autoheader >=2.50)
  (make sure your system wide "automake" points to a recent version!)
- GNU Libtool
  (for more information, go to http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)

If you get the tree from the repository, you will need to use the autogen.sh
script. It calls all the GNU tools needed to prepare the tree configuration.
