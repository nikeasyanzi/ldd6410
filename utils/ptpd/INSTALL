Run make inside the src directory to compile the ptpd binary.

You can influence the compilation by setting variables on the
make command line:
   CPPFLAGS=-DPTPD_DBGV
        detailed debugging
   CPPFLAGS=-DPTPD_DBG
        less detailed debugging
   CPPFLAGS="-DHAVE_LINUX_NET_TSTAMP_H -Idep/include"
        enable -z linux_hw/linux_sw mode, using bundled
        Linux header file

The resulting binary works as-is without having to install it.
