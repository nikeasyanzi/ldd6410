<h1>Graphical Event Viewer Plugin User Manual</h1>

<P>
This viewers shows a list of the events that are included in the currently
viewed time interval. This is a detailed manner of seeing each event's
information.

<P>
Showing this viewer is as simple as adding it to the current tab by selecting
the Insert Event Viewer menu item from the Tools menu or by clicking on
this viewer's Insertion Button. You can then use up/down arrows buttons and
delete button when the viewer is selected to change it's position in the
tab or remove it.

<P>
It them appears in the current tab. If there are events to display in the
current time frame selected by the tab, you should already see them in the
list. You can move the scrollbar on the right side up and down to display
the different events in the list. As you can see, this list is limited to
the currently viewed time interval. In order to see more events in this
list, you can use a Zoom Extended of the main window (this will show all
the trace's events). You can also specify the laps of time you want to see
using the main window's Show Time Frame.

<P>
One important feature of this plugin is the ability to inform the tab in
which it resides of the currently selected event. By clicking on an event,
it will appear highlighted in the list and this event will then become the
current event.

<P>
The events shown are selected by the filters applied on them. Hence, you can
configure the viewer's associated filter using various criterias in order
to select the events you want to show.

<P>
By clicking on the viewer with the right mouse button, a popup menu appears,
giving the opportunity to configure the viewer's filter or to configure
the viewer itself. Configuration of the filter will be explained in another
document, but event viewer's configuration follows.

<P>
The viewer's configuration window permits a selection of the fields that
must be displayed in the event viewer. There are fields which can always be
selected, as, for example, event type or time of the event, while there are
fields that are specific to the event types present in the trace. A browse
list, following the nested architecture of the description of events, will
show all the available fields on the left. A list at the right side will
list all the currently selectied fields. Two arrows in the middle of the
two lists can be used to add or remove a field from the shown fields list.
