>&#13;This section describes the main functionnalities that are provided by the LTTV
GUI and how to use them.
</P
><P
>&#13;By default, when the lttv GUI starts with all the graphical modules loaded,
it loads the statistics viewer, the control flow viewer, and the detailed event
list inside a tab. Other viewers can be added later to this tab by interacting
with the main window. Let's describe the operations available on the window :

>&#13;This toolbar allows you to navigate through the basic functionnalities of LTTV.
The first button opens a new window and the second one, a new tab. You can leave
your mouse over the buttons to read the information provided by the tooltips.
</P

><P
>&#13;This notebook, containing different tabs, lets you select the "Trace Set" you
want to interact with. A trace set is an aggregation of traces, synchronised in
time. You may also want to use one tab per viewer by simply cloning the traceset
to a new tab. This way, you can have vertically stacked viewers in one tab, as
well as different viewers, independant from the time interval. Note that once
the Trace Set cloning is done, each trace set becomes completely independant.
For Traceset cloning, see the File Menu.
</P

><LI
><P
>&#13;These buttons let you control the computation in progress on a trace. As
sometimes the computation may last for a while, you may want to stop it, restart
it from the beginning or simply to continue from where you stopped. This is
exactly what those three buttons offer you.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;Buttons on the right side of the last spacer are semantically different from the
others. While the other buttons at the left side of the bar are built in the
lttv program and let you operate the basic functionnalities, the buttons at the
right side let you add a viewer to the active Tab. They belong to the
viewers themselves. The number of buttons that appears there should directly
depend on the number of viewer's modules loaded.

>&#13;This is a tree representing the multiple statistics available for the current
traceset. This is shown by the guistatistics viewer.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;This is the Y axis of the guicontrolflow viewer. It shows the process list of
the traced system. You may notice that it grows : it dynamically adds
process when they appear in the trace.
</P

>&#13;This is a (missing) time bar for the X axis. Maybe will it be used for viewer
specific buttons eventually. Work in progress.

>&#13;The is the current time selected. The concept of current event and current time
selected is synchronised in a Tab for all the viewers. The control flow viewer
shows it a vertical white dotted line. You move this marker by clicking on the
background of the process state graph. This graph shows evolution of each
process's state through time. The meaning of the colors will be explained later.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;This is the details event list. It shown the detailed information about each
event of the trace. It is synchronised with the current time and current event,
so selecting an event changes other viewer's current time and reciprocally.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;You can enter the values of start time and end time you wish to see on the
screen here. It also supports pasting time as text input, simply by clicking of
the "Time Frame", "start" or "end:" fields. A valid entry consists of any
digital input separated by any quantity of non digital characters. For example :
"I start at 356247.124626 and stop at 724524.453455" would be a valid input
for the "Time Frame" field.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;This horizontal scrollbar modifies the window of time shown by all the viewers
in the tab. It is linked with the fields below it (described at number 10 and
12). Another way to modify the time shown is to use the zoom buttons of the
toolbar (yes, the ones that looks like magnifying glasses).
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;This field works just like the "Time Frame" field. It modifies the current time
selected by the viewers. For example, changing its value will change the current
event selected by the detailed events list and the current time selected by the
control flow viewer.
