<h1>Linux Trace Toolkit trace analysis tools</h1>

<P>The Linux Trace Toolkit Visualizer, lttv, is a modular and extensible
tool to read, analyze, annotate and display traces. It accesses traces through
the libltt API and produces either textual output or graphical output using
the GTK library. This document describes the architecture of lttv for
developers.

<P>Lttv is a small executable which links to the trace reading API, libltt,
and to the glib and gobject base libraries. 
By itself it contains just enough code to
convert a trace to a textual format and to load modules. 
The public
functions defined in the main program are available to all modules.
A number of
<I>text</I> modules may be dynamically loaded to extend the capabilities of
lttv, for instance to compute and print various statistics.

<P>A more elaborate module, traceView, dynamically links to the GTK library
and to a support library, libgtklttv. When loaded, it displays graphical
windows in which one or more viewers in subwindows may be used to browse 
details of events in traces. A number of other graphical modules may be 
dynamically loaded to offer a choice of different viewers (e.g., process, 
CPU or block devices state versus time).

<H2>Main program: main.c</H2>

<P>The main program parses the command line options, loads the requested 
modules and executes the hooks registered in the global attributes
(/hooks/main/before, /hooks/main/core, /hooks/main/after).

<H3>Hooks for callbacks: hook.h (hook.c)</H3>

<P>In a modular extensible application, each module registers callbacks to
insure that it gets called at appropriate times (e.g., after command line
options processing, at each event to compute statistics...). Hooks and lists
of hooks are defined for this purpose and are normally stored in the global
attributes under /hooks/*.

<H3>Browsable data structures: iattribute.h (iattribute.c)</H3>

<P>In several places, functions should operate on data structures for which the
list of members is extensible. For example, the statistics printing 
module should not be
modified each time new statistics are added by other modules.
For this purpose, a gobject interface is defined in iattribute.h to
enumerate and access members in a data structure. Even if new modules
define custom data structures for efficiently storing statistics while they
are being computed, they will be generically accessible for the printing
routine as long as they implement the iattribute interface.

<H3>Extensible data structures: attribute.h (attribute.c)</H3>

<P>To allow each module to add its needed members to important data structures,
for instance new statistics for processes, the LttvAttributes type is
a container for named typed values. Each attribute has a textual key (name) 
and an associated typed value. 
It is similar to a C data structure except that the
number and type of the members can change dynamically. It may be accessed
either directly or through the iattribute interface.

<P>Some members may be LttvAttributes objects, thus forming a tree of
attributes, not unlike hierarchical file systems or registries. This is used
for the global attributes, used to exchange information between modules.
Attributes are also attached to trace sets, traces and contexts to allow
storing arbitrary attributes.

<H3>Modules: module.h (module.c)</H3>

<P>The benefit of modules is to avoid recompiling the whole application when
adding new functionality. It also helps insuring that only the needed code 
is loaded in memory.

<P>Modules are loaded explicitly, being on the list of default modules or
requested by a command line option, with g_module_open. The functions in
the module are not directly accessible.
Indeed, direct, compiled in, references to their functions would be dangerous
since they would exist even before (if ever) the module is loaded.
Each module contains a function named <i>init</i>. Its handle is obtained by
the main program using g_module_symbol and is called.
The <i>init</i> function of the module 
then calls everything it needs from the main program or from libraries,
typically registering callbacks in hooks lists stored in the global attributes.
No module function other than <i>init</i> is 
directly called. Modules cannot see the functions from other modules since
they may or not be loaded at the same time.

<P>The modules must see the declarations for the functions
used, from the main program and from libraries, by including the associated 
.h files. The list of libraries used must be provided as argument when
a module is linked. This will insure that these libraries get loaded
automatically when that module is loaded.

<P>Libraries contain a number of functions available to modules and to the main
program. They are loaded automatically at start time if linked by the main
program or at module load time if linked by that module. Libraries are
useful to contain functions needed by several modules. Indeed, functions
used by a single module could be simply part of that module.

<P>A list of loaded modules is maintained. When a module is requested, it
is verified if the module is already loaded. A module may request other modules
at the beginning of its init function. This will insure that these modules
get loaded and initialized before the init function of the current module
proceeds. Circular dependencies are obviously to be avoided as the 
initialization order among mutually dependent modules will be arbitrary.

<H3>Command line options: option.h (option.c)</H3>

<P>Command line options are added as needed by the main program and by modules
as they are loaded. Thus, while options are scanned and acted upon (i.e.,
options to load modules), the
list of options to recognize continues to grow. The options module registers
to get called by /hooks/main/before. It offers hooks /hooks/option/before
and /hooks/option/after which are called just before and just after
processing the options. Many modules register in their init function to
be called in /hooks/options/after to verify the options specified and
register further hooks accordingly.

<H2>Trace Analysis</H2>

<P>The main purpose of the lttv application is to process trace sets,
calling registered hooks for each event in the traces and maintaining
a context (system state, accumulated statistics).

<H3>Trace Sets: traceSet.h (traceSet.c)</H3>

<P>Trace sets are defined such that several traces can be analyzed together.
Traces may be added and removed as needed to a trace set.
The main program stores a trace set in /trace_set/default.
The content of the trace_set is defined by command line options and it is
used by analysis modules (batch or interactive).

<H3>Trace Set Analysis: processTrace.h (processTrace.c)</H3>

<p>The function <i>lttv_process_trace_set</i> loops over all the events
in the specified trace set for the specified time interval. <I>Before</I> 
Hooks are first
called for the trace set and for each trace and tracefile 
(one per cpu plus control tracefiles) in the trace set.
Then hooks are called for
each event in sorted time order. Finally, <i>after</i> hooks are called
for the trace set and for each trace and tracefile in it. 

<P>To call all the event hooks in sorted time order, a priority queue
(or sorted tree) is used. The first event from each tracefile is read and its
time used as key in the sorted tree. The event with the lowest key is removed
from the tree, the next event from that tracefile is read and reinserted in
the tree. 

<p>Each hook is called with a LttvContext gobject as call data. The LttvContext
object for the trace set before/after hooks is provided in the call to
lttv_process_trace_set. Shallow copies of this context are made for each
trace in the trace set for the trace before/after hooks. Again, shallow
copies of each trace context are made for each tracefile in a trace.
The context for each tracefile is used both for the tracefile before/after
hooks and when calling the hooks for the contained events.

<p>The lttv_process_trace_set function sets appropriately the fields in the
context before calling a hook. For example, when calling a hook event,
the context contains:

<DL>
<DT>trace_set_context<DD> context for the trace set.
<DT>trace_context<DD> context for the trace.
<DT>ts<DD> trace set.
<DT>t<DD> trace.
<DT>tf<DD> tracefile.
<DT>e<DD> event.
</DL>

<P>The cost of providing all this information in the context is relatively
low. When calling a hook from one event to the next, in the same tracefile,
only the event field needs to be changed.
The contexts used when processing traces are key to extensibility and
performance. New modules may need additional data members in the context to
store intermediate results. For this purpose, it is possible to derive
subtypes of LttvContext in order to add new data members.


<H3>Reconstructing the system state from the trace: state.h (state.c)</H3>

<P>The events in a trace often represent state transitions in the traced
system. When the trace is processed, and events accessed in time sorted
order, it is thus possible to reconstruct in part the state of the 
traced system: state of each CPU, process, disk queue. The state of each
process may contain detailed information such as opened file descriptors
and memory map if needed by the analysis and if sufficient information is
available in the trace. This incrementally updated state information may be
used to display state graphs, or simply to compute state dependent
statistics (time spent in user or system mode, waiting for a file...).

<P>
When tracing starts, at T0, no state is available. The OS state may be
obtained through "initial state" events which enumerate the important OS data
structures.  Unless the state is obtained atomically, other events
describing state changes may be interleaved in the trace and must be
processed in the correct order.  Once all the special initial state
events are obtained, at Ts, the complete state is available. From there the
system state can be deduced incrementally from the events in the trace.

<P>
Analysis tools must be prepared for missing state information. In some cases
only a subset of events is traced, in others the trace may be truncated
in <i>flight recorder</i> mode.

<P>
In interactive processing, the interval for which processing is required 
varies. After scrolling a viewer, the events in the new interval to display
need to be processed in order to redraw the view. To avoid restarting
the processing at the trace start to reconstruct incrementally the system
state, the computed state may be memorized at regular interval, for example at
each 100 000 events, in a time indexed database associated with a trace.
To conserve space, it may be possible in some cases to only store state 
differences. 

<p>To process a specific time interval, the state at the beginning of the
interval would be obtained by copying the last preceeding saved state
and processing the events since then to update the state.

<p>A new subtype of LttvContext, LttvStateContext, is defined to add storage
for the state information. It defines a trace set state as a set of trace
state. The trace state is composed of processes, CPUs and block devices.
Each CPU has a currently executing process and each process state keeps
track the interrupt stack frames (faults, interrupts,
system calls), executable file name and other information such as opened
file descriptors. Each frame stores the process status, entry time
and last status change time.

<p>File state.c provides state updating hooks to be called when the trace is
processed. When a scheduling change event is delivered to the hook, for
instance, the current process for the CPU is changed and the state of the
incoming and outgoing processes is changed.
The state updating hooks are stored in the global attributes under 
/hooks/state/core/trace_set/before, after, 
/hooks/state/core/trace/before, after...
to be used by processing functions requiring state updating (batch and 
interactive alalysis, computing the state at time T by updating a preceeding
saved state...).

<H3>Computing Statistics: stats.h (stats.c)</H3>

<p>This file defines a subtype of LttvStateContext, LttvStatsContext,
to store statistics on various aspects of a trace set. The LttvTraceSetStats
structure contains a set of LttvTraceStats structures. Each such structure
contains structures for CPUs, processes, interrupt types (IRQ, system call,
fault), subtypes (individual system calls, IRQs or faults) and
block devices. The CPUs also contain structures for processes, interrupt types,
subtypes and block devices. Process structures similarly contain
structures for interrupt types, subtypes and block devices. At each level
(trace set, trace, cpu, process, interrupt stack frames)
attributes are used to store statistics. 

<p>File stats.c provides statistics computing hooks to be called when the
trace is processed. For example, when a <i>write</i> event is processed, 
the attribute <i>BytesWritten</i> in the corresponding system, cpu, process,
interrupt type (e.g. system call) and subtype (e.g. write) is incremented 
by the number of bytes stored in the event. When the processing is finished, 
perhaps in the after hooks, the number of bytes written and other statistics 
may be summed over all CPUs for a given process, over all processes for a 
given CPU or over all traces.

<p>The basic set of statistics computed by stats.c include for the whole
   trace set:

<UL>
<LI>Trace start time, end time and duration.
<LI>Total number of events.
<LI>Number of each event type (Interrupts, faults, system calls...)
<LI>For each interrupt type and each subtype, the number of each event type.
<LI>For each system:
  <UL>
  <LI>Total number of events.
  <LI>Number of each event type (Interrupts, faults, system calls...)
  <LI>For each interrupt type and each subtype, the number of each event type.
  <LI>For each CPU:
    <UL>
    <LI> CPU id
    <LI> User/System time
    <LI> Number of each event type
    <LI> For each interrupt type and each subtype, 
         the number of each event type.
    </UL>
  <LI>For each block device:
    <UL>
    <LI> block device name
    <LI> time busy/idle, average queue length
    <LI> Number of each relevant event type (requests added, merged, served)
    </UL>
  <LI>For each process:
    <UL>
    <LI> Exec'ed file names.
    <LI> Start and end time, User/System time
    <LI> Number of each event type
    <LI> For each interrupt type and each subtype, 
         the number of each event type.
    </UL>
  </UL>
</UL>

<P>The structure to store statistics differs from the state storage structure
in several ways. Statistics are maintained in different ways (per CPU all
processes, per process all CPUs, per process on a given CPU...). Furthermore,
statistics are maintained for all processes which existed during the trace
while the state at time T only stores information about current processes.

<P>The hooks defined by stats.c are stored in the global attributes under
/hooks/stats/core/trace_set/before, after, 
/hooks/stats/core/trace/before, after to be used by processing functions
interested in statistics.

<H3>Filtering events: filter.h (filter.c)</H3>

<P>
Filters are used to select which events in a trace are shown in a viewer or are
used in a computation. The filtering rules are based on the values of 
events fields. The filter module receives a filter expression and computes
a compiled filter. The compiled filter then serves as hook data for 
<i>check</i> event 
filter hooks which, given a context containing an event, 
return TRUE or FALSE to 
indicate if the event satisfies the filter. Trace and tracefile <i>check</i>
filter hooks
may be used to determine if a system and CPU satisfy the filter. Finally,
the filter module has a function to return the time bounds, if any, imposed
by a filter.

<P>For some applications, the hooks provided by the filter module may not 
be sufficient, since they are based on simple boolean combinations
of comparisons between fields and constants. In that case, custom code may be
used for <i>check</i> hooks during the processing. An example of complex
filtering could be to only show events belonging to processes which consumed
more than 10% of the CPU in the last 10 seconds.

<p>In module filter.c, filters are specified using textual expressions 
with AND, OR, NOT operations on
nested subexpressions. Primitive expressions compare an event field to
a constant. In the graphical user interface, a filter editor is provided.

<PRE><TT>
tokens: ( ! && || == <= >= > < != name [ ] int float string )

expression = ( expression ) OR ! expression OR
     expression && expression OR expression || expression OR 
     simple_expression

simple_expression = field_selector OP value

value = int OR float OR string OR enum

field_selector = component OR component . field_selector

component = name OR name [ int ]
</TT></PRE>


<H3>Batch Analysis: batchAnalysis.h (batchAnalysis.c)</H3>

<p>This module registers to be called by the main program (/hooks/main/core). 
When called, it gets the current trace set (/trace_set/default), 
state updating hooks (/hooks/state/*) the statistics hooks 
(/hooks/stats/*) and other analysis hooks (/hooks/batch/*)
and runs lttv_process_trace_set for the entire
trace set time interval. This simple processing of the complete trace set
is normally sufficient for batch operations such as converting a trace to
text and computing various statistics.


<H3>Text output for events and statistics: textDump.h (textDump.c)</H3>

<P>
This module registers hooks (/hooks/batch)
to print a textual representation of each event
(event hooks) and to print the content of the statistics accumulated in the
context (after trace set hook).

<H2>Trace Set Viewers</H2>

<p>
A library, libgtklttv, is defined to provide utility functions for 
the second set of modules, wich compose the interactive graphical user 
interface. It offers functions to create and interact with top level trace 
viewing windows, and to insert specialized embedded viewer modules. 
The libgtklttv library requires the gtk library.
The viewer modules include a detailed event list, eventsTableView,
a process state graph, processStateView, and a CPU state graph, cpuStateView.

<p>
The top level gtkTraceSet, defined in libgtklttv, 
window has the usual FILE EDIT... menu and a toolbar.
It has an associated trace set (and filter) and contains several tabs, each
containing several vertically stacked time synchronized trace set viewers.
It manages the space allocated to each contained viewer, the menu items and
tools registered by each contained viewer and the current time and current
time interval.

<P>
When viewers change the current time or time interval, the gtkTraceSet
window notifies all contained viewers. When one or more viewers need
redrawing, the gtkTraceSet window calls the lttv_process_trace_set
function for the needed time interval, after computing the system state
for the interval start time. While events are processed, drawing hooks 
from the viewers are called.

<P>
TO COMPLETE; description and motivation for the gtkTraceSet widget structure
and interaction with viewers. Description and motivation for the detailed
event view and process state view.
