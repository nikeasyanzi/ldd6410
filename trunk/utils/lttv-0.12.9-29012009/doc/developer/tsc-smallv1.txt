event header


32 bits header
Aligned on 32 bits
  1 bit to select event type
  4 bits event ID
    16 events (too few)
  27 bits TSC (cut MSB)
    wraps 32 times per second at 4GHz
    each wraps spaced from 0.03125s
    100HZ clock : tick each 0.01s
      detect wrap at least each 3 jiffies (dangerous, may miss)
    granularity : 2^0 = 1 cycle : 0.25ns @4GHz
payload size known by facility

96 or 128 bits header (full 64 bits TSC, useful when no heartbeat available
  size depends on internal alignment)

Align on 64 bits
  64 bits TSC

Must put the event ID fields first in the large (64, 96-128 bits) event headers
Create a "compact" facility which reserves the facility IDs with the MSB at 1.
  - or better : select mapping for events
What is the minimum granularity required ? (so we know how much LSB to cut)
  - How much can synchonized CPU TSCs drift apart one from another ?
    PLL
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop
    static phase offset -> tracking jitter
    25 MHz oscillator on motherboard for CPU
    jitter : expressed in Â±picoseconds (should therefore be lower than 0.25ns)

    NEED MORE INFO.
  - What is the cacheline synchronization latency between the CPUs ?
    Worse case : Intel Core 2, Intel Xeon 5100, Intel core solo, intel core duo
    Unified L2 cache. http://www.intel.com/design/processor/manuals/253668.pdf
    Intel Core 2, Intel Xeon 5100 
    http://www.intel.com/design/processor/manuals/253665.pdf
    Up to 10.7 GB/s FSB
    http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/mobile/display/core2duo_2.html
                      Intel Core Duo     Intel Core 2 Duo
    L2 cache latency  14 cycles          14 cycles
    (round-trip : 28 cycles) 7ns @4GHz
    sparc64 : between threads : shares L1 cache.
    suspected to be ~2 cycles total (1+1) (to check)
  - How close (cycle-wise) can be two consecutive recorded events in the same
    buffer ? (~200ns, time for logging an event) (~800 cycles @4GHz)
  - Tracing code itself : if it's at a subbuffer boundary, more check to do.
    Must see the maximum duration of a non interrupted probe.
    Worse case (had NMIs enabled) : 6997 cycles. 1749 ns @4GHz.
    TODO : test with NMIs disabled and HT disabled.
    Ordering can be changed if an interrupt comes between the memory operation
    and the tracer call. Therefore, we cannot rely on more precision than the
    expected interrupt handler duration. (guess : ~10000cycles, 2500ns@4GHz)
  - If there is a faster interconnect between the CPUs, it can be a problem, but
    seems to only be proprietary interconnects, not used in general.
  - IPI are expected to take much more than 28 cycles.
What is the minimum wrap-around interval ? (must be safe for timer interrupt
miss and multiple timer HZ (configurable) and CPU MHZ frequencies)
Must align _all_ headers on 32 bits, not 64.

Granularity : 800ns (200 cycles@4GHz) : 2^9 = 512 (remove 9 LSB)
  Number of LSB skipped : first_bit(probe_duration_in_cycles)-1

Min wrap : 100HZ system, each 3 timer ticks : 0.03s (32-4 MSB for 4 GHZ : 0.26s)
  (heartbeat each 100HZ, to be safe)
  Number of MSB to skip :
    32 - first_bit(( (expected_longest_cli()[ms] + max_timer_interval[ms]) * 2 /
                   cpu_khz ))


9LSB + 4MSB = 13 bits total. 12 bits for event IDs : 4096 events.
